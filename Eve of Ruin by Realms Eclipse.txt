"Eve of Ruin" by Realms Eclipse


The Eastern land, it is eruptin'
Chaos ragin', arrows nockin'
You're old enough to fight, but not for choosin'
You don't believe in war, but what's that weapon you're wieldin'?
And even the Iliac Bay has bodies floatin'

But you tell me over and over and over again, warrior
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of ruin

Don't you comprehend what I'm tryin' to say?
And can't you feel the fears I'm feelin' today?
If the Oblivion gates are opened, there's no runnin' away
There'll be no one to be savin' while the world is decayin'
Take a look around you, warrior, it's bound to scare you, warrior

And you tell me over and over and over again, warrior
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of ruin

Yeah, my blood's so mad, feels like it's boilin'
I'm sittin' here just contemplatin'
I can't twist the truth, it knows no illusion 
Handful of leaders don't pass rules and regulation
And the psijic order alone can't bring total unification
When Argronian respect is disintegratin'
This whole crazy realm is just too frustratin'

And you tell me over and over and over again, warrior
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of ruin

Think of all the hate there is in Windhelm
Then take a look around to Cyrodiil
Ah, you may leave here, for four days in Aetherius
But when you return, it's the same old Nirn
The clashing of the blades, the pride and disgrace
You can bury your kin, but don't leave a trace
Hate your next-door Dunmeri, but don't forget to say grace

And tell me over and over and over and over again, warrior
You don't believe we're on the eve of ruin
No, no, you don't believe we're on the eve of ruin
