"Frozen Lands" by Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1]
To arise with a dovah's roar  
For a fate that is far from my own  
In this land I've awakened once more  
Feels like home, yet it's shrouded in stone  
And the mountains of snow in the twilight  
Reach out to the echoes of time  
With the Thu'um and the steel for the fight  
A destiny carved in the stone

[Chorus]
Down, down falls the snow, Dovahkiin's foe, whispers of legends untold  
Down, drenched by the storm, dovahhe reborn, Skyrim shall rise from the cold  
Guided by shouts ever led  
These ancient paths we tread  
Over the frozen lands  
Do you believe, do you believe now?  
Frozen lands  
Wake up and breathe, do you believe now?  

[Verse 2]
Once a wunduniik, alone and cast  
Now they call me, their hero, their hope  
To confront all the shadows past  
To unite under one bannerâ€™s scope  
And this power now held in my voice  
Will not yield to the darkness of old  
Ancient gods of the mountains rejoice  
As the prophecy's tale is retold  

[Chorus]
Down, down falls the snow, Dovahkiin's foe, whispers of legends untold  
Down, drenched by the storm, dovahhe reborn, Skyrim shall rise from the cold  
Guided by shouts ever led  
These ancient paths we tread  
Over the frozen lands  
Do you believe, do you believe now?  
Frozen lands  
Wake up and breathe, do you believe now?  

[Bridge]
Is it all that you hoped for and more?  
Is it all you imagined in lore?  

[Verse 3]
Shattered in battle, scales they will fall  
Cries of the dovah, echoing call  
Mountains will mourn, the legends weave  
Order reborn from the ice that we cleave  
Taste of the frost, wounds from the war  
Spinning the tales, we forge evermore  
Touched by the ancient, knowledge we seek  
The valor, the power, we stand for the weak  
Souls in the mist, watch over the land  
Awakened by shouts, together we'll stand  
Deep in the roots, history's womb  
A beautiful blue paints the sky with a loom  

[Chorus]
Down, down falls the snow, Dovahkiin's foe, whispers of legends untold  
Down, drenched by the storm, dovahhe reborn, Skyrim shall rise from the cold  
Guided by shouts ever led  
These ancient paths we tread  
Over the frozen lands  
Do you believe, do you believe now?  
Frozen lands  
Wake up and breathe, do you believe now?  
Frozen lands  
Do you believe, do you believe now?  
Frozen lands  
Wake up and breathe, do you believe now?
