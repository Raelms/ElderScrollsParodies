"Fight like Oblivion" by Realms Eclipse

[Intro]
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
Beware the gates of Oblivion's keep
This realm of dread, where Daedra creep
I will stand firm, I will not flee
With sword in hand, I'll set us free
I told them one day
I'd rise to be the Champion of Cyrodiil
They told me to close the gates
So you know what?
I did

[Verse 1]
And that might sound perilous
But that's the truth, and I'll prove it, bitch
Welcome to Oblivion, I'm moving in
Someone tell Mehrunes Dagon I'm through with him
Have you ever seen a Daedric prince?
Nothin' but a nightmare of wicked sins
I don't need your petty, mortal armies, 'cause homie
I'm through with this
Do you think that this blade will fit?
Thank the Nine, let me start swingin' shit
Lots of chaos in the Daedric realm
And everybody here is fearing it
When I go to war, I might go berserk
It all depends what kind of quest I'm in
Slay you with a longsword, slice your head right off
Leave your corpse where you standin'
Destruction, isn't it gratuitous
I've got the legions like "who did this?"
What's the matter? Are you new to this?
Let me choose your fate, Oblivion it is
They told me I could save the world when Tamriel was crumbling over
Hold up, is it just me?
Or did it just get colder?

[Chorus]
You have nowhere to go, abandon all hope
You have nowhere to hide from the Daedroth's tide
I know my foes all too well
Nothin' left to do but fight like Oblivion

[Verse 2]
It's in my nature, call me Hero, the Daedra slayer
And I'm fightin' well when I'm raisin' Oblivion
Better keep your distance, it'll make you safer
My fireballs gonna turn you to vapor
Then I'll make this realm a vacant crater
I'm an exterminator, when I wear my armor
Sending every Daedra to meet their maker
You could say that I'm on par with Talos
Compared to him, my Dragon blood is greater
Somebody tell Dagon, "say your prayers"
Make sure his defeat is written in history
Whether you're Imperial, Khajiitti, or Dunmeri
None of that matters, abandon your borders
Slaying Clannfears, wrecking the Xivilais
Sever the head, and mess up what's left of it
I'm seein' red, forget about etiquette
Desecrate every Daedric nemesis
I'll cut you in half, so you'd better split
You'll end up like the rest of these skeletons
Mortal vessels to Daedric developments
I won't let 'em in, I will never quit
Pushin' back this Daedric malevolence
So all of your respect you better give
'Cause in Oblivion, I'm the true Champion

[Chorus]
You have nowhere to go, abandon all hope
You have nowhere to hide from the Daedroth's tide
I know my foes all too well
Nothin' left to do but fight like Oblivion
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)

[Bridge]
Beware the gates of Oblivion's keep
This realm of dread, where Daedra creep
I will stand firm, I will not flee
With sword in hand, I'll set us free
Flesh and bone, the creatures feed
Lock and load my Staff of Destruction
Light them up like fireworks
Just don't let them see you bleed
And in these troubled times
Don't you lose sight of yourself
There's nothin' left for you to do
But fight like Oblivion

[Chorus]
You have nowhere to go, abandon all hope
You have nowhere to hide from the Daedroth's tide
I know my foes all too well
Nothin' left to do but fight like Oblivion
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
(Fight like Oblivion)
