"Morrowind vs Skyrim" by Realms Eclipse

[Morrowind]
I'm a veteran adventurer, never getting tired
Living off the land, much better than a fighter
I've fought more daedra than you'll see in your life
And my only mission isn't leveling up every night
If you wanna join me, I'll leave the silt strider on
It's Skyrim you oughta say goodbye to your spawn
Cuz if I had a level, it would be a high one
Your Thu'um and shouts won't hold up to my spells

[Skyrim]
It's time Bethesda took it up a notch
Your spells can never blast past the dragons I got
Fighting trolls and draugr and you'd be bragging
While I got Daedric armor
Slaying Alduin the dragon
Cryin' so much you fast travel every time
I think Morrowind's like an old paradigm
Grab the Dragonborn's shout just to break the tension
Then bust the Nerevarine into the next dimension

[Chorus]
This ain't no game
My life's insane
I've fought through draugr and stormy weather
We just survive
All day and night
But tell me who can do it better?

[Morrowind]
Stop the beat! your town is burning
You just got griefed, was it worth the learning?
They took your stuff to make it even
Worse
Try quicksaving if you got your feelings hurt
I'm a Tribunal slayer, an adventurer
So my inventory isn't full of clutter
I got levitation, so who needs armor?
You're a FPF; First Person Farmer!

[Skyrim]
Oh, I'm getting griefed? that sure blows
But at least Skyrim has the best online mods
Don't need a journal to put this man to shame
I mean, only old scroll keepers be playin' your game
Yeah, in my world, I am a god
While in your game, you can't even mod
Last time you went outside? I'm thinking never
Fus Ro Dah you down, send you to Sovngarde forever

[Chorus]

[Morrowind]
Keep your fancy dragons, I only need cliff racers to be awesome

[Skyrim]
Please, your game style's been irrelevant since Oblivion

[Morrowind]
Take a seat dude, oh wait, YOU DON'T HAVE SCALES

[Skyrim]
Even ESO is better than you

[Morrowind]
Well, at least I didn't sell out to casuals

[Skyrim]
Well, at least casuals were interested in me

[Morrowind]
Oh yeah, well

[Morrowind & Skyrim]
MORROWIND/SKYRIM IS THE GREATEST RPG GAME EVER!!!

[Morrowind]
Step back or I'll steamroll ya
Don't mess with this scroll holder
Multiplayer's overrated
When all your servers do is cause a hold up
Don't got no friends with me
My friends are NPCs
I can't wait for Skyrim to drop dead
After all, you and your friends are Thu'um heads!

[Skyrim]
A Thu'um joke, huh? That's never been said
That's as original as your cliff racer threat
Step up to the mic, I become aggressive
I've never seen a ripoff so unimpressive
I know that you'll never test me again
This is like iron armor against Daedric skin
The sun has set, so I guess I'll retire
Since I'm done roasting this mudcrab over my fire

[Chorus]
