"Hallelujah Hero" by Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1]  
One lucky soul finds a way  
For wielding a brand new daedric blade  
All the days of war and pitiful cries  
The pitiful chants were all a long time ago  

[Pre-Chorus 1]  
That's the way it all will end  
Die a warrior, you never will  
Oblivion's here, unleash your spells

[Verse 2]  
Well, the Nine above have never been on my side or your side  
Hallelujah hero
Walking through the fire like a Dovahkiin 
Kicking the Gate and facing Molag Bal  

[Pre-Chorus 2]  
That's the way it all will end  
Die a warrior, you never will  
Oblivion's here, unleash your  

[Chorus]  
Aetherius, where did you go?  
People are searching, searching for hope  
So easy blaming the Daedra  
Mortals the sinners  
Forever it burns
