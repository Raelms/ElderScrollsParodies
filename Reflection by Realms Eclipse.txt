"Reflection" by Realms Eclipse

Back for the encore, chaos is my charm
(I know you wanted it)
Madness at the door, welcoming the harm
(Don't bother knockin' it)
I'm putting on a show, let's unleash the storm
(Call in all the kids)
It will be grandiose (Like a Daedric lord)


I am the Mad God, in my realm, I'm dominant
The jester of Nirn, my whims are omnipotent
I look at my reflection, chaos reflected in it
Just like the chasm of my mind, there's no limit to it
Don't-don't-don't put your trust in me, I thrive on lunacy
Order's a chain, and I've come here to set you free
All for the chaos, a symphony of anarchy
'Cause this is madness, where insanity is all you'll see
You might just find the Shivering Isles a paradox
What's inside the mind? Unravel all the tangled knots
Take this realm of mine, feel the mania in every thought
My schemes are slipping, yet I've come too far to be caught
Behind this laugh, there's a darkness so malevolent
Madness ballooning, containment is irrelevant
'Cause I'm the ruler, my subjects are delirious
So let me guide them, make sure everyone is curious
Here comes a one-god chaotic band
See this army of madness, I'm in command
With a performance so erratic, I'm the maestro grand
They wanted reason, but now they cling to the lunatic's hand
Look upon my throne, I just imagined it
Familiar is the madness, I’ve come to master it
To make me whole, I’ll split your mind like a schizoid
But on a cosmic level, I'm the universe's void
My palace is a maze of chaos, how ludicrous
I'll lead a madcap parade, so tumultuous
How flamboyant a display, did I say I'm a Mad God?
No wonder why I revel in the facade
But I'm not dropping this charade 'til I've exhausted it
I keep the madness underneath, but it's prospering
I'm stronger in the chaos, what ironic dominance
The kind of Daedroth who is crafting out his audience


Is this all just a reflection
Or another misdirection?
Don't we all crave a distraction
From that which offers no protection?


Like your own reflection
Looking back from the other side
You thought you knew him, what a deception
Coming back for another fight if it's livin
No imperfection like a mask I pull off at night
My every movement beyond perception and all detection
Are you the real one or my reflection?


Red-stained hands and death-filled eyes
On this doomed isle, chaos flies
With gift-wrapped insanities, disguising lies
Time to tie the bow and enlighten lives


I'm not the Mad God, I'm the order reinstating him
Call me the Grey Prince, the tide is changing in
'Cause I've been fighting the curse, the order's cry strong
But people are lost, pulled their minds behind throngs
Studied the rigidity of logic, got my sovereignty
Buckle up 'cause now my power's reclaiming property
My realm, now freed from madness, I am ushering
But if you thought you'd see chaos, you've stopped misgoverning
Nobody needs to fear, 'cause I'll bring order in
You're stuck with me now, just like a disciplined kingpin
Look at what we've become, a world of harmony
If you don't wanna play your part, you will, 'cause I'm demanding it
I built a kingdom on unyielding principles
I got a list of laws, it's so strict, it's almost biblical
Sorta like a tyrant, but my rule is sensible
Nonetheless, once I find your chaos, I'm erasing it
Just like a cure in your system, I'm correcting it
I kinda find it like a duty, so when I'm enforcing it
I look forward to my reign, but when I'm in power again
I'll strip off the chaos because order's what I am


Is a reflection
Comin' back from the other side
Your point of view is just a deception
Coming back for another fight to become leader
I am pretendin' like a mask I pull off at night
My every movement gave you misdirection, then you forget them
Don't fight your Daedroth, you must respect them
I'll force you need them, if not invent them
Now I'm the real one, you're the reflection!
