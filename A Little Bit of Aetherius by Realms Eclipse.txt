"A Little Bit of Aetherius" by Realms Eclipse

[Intro]
Where were you? Where were you?
Make this realm eternal (Where were you?)
Have no conflict (Where—)
When there's only room in Aetherius
For the chosen, I have found
You'll be unworthy of my blessing
So you know what's going down (Uh, yo)

[Verse 1]
Attention, all mortals or whatever's left of them
We got some bad Daedra in the realms again
I know what I gotta do, let me banish them
You're a long ways off from Aetherius
And I'll bet you've never been
Wanna meet your maker?
Grab yourself a Scroll, get to levelin'
I am Talos, the God-Emperor, obviously
Halting apocalypses, mortals will drop to their knees
Sorry, you wanna talk to me?
Nah, you're nothin' but another mockery
I gotta lock up Nirn, Oblivion’s not free
Molag, you're toxic, missus, I'm callin' it quits
Cancel our plan to start a covenant, you corrupted the bliss
Guess that's what I get for fraternizing with the enemy again
Was I fantasizing?
Never put a Daedra on a pedestal especially if his realm’s a Devil, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
What we had is fuckin' dead, no matter
I can get myself a necromancer
Lost the magic, guess we got low magicka
Follow me, 'cause all we really need is a little bit of—

[Chorus]
Aetherius (Aetherius) with a little bit of Oblivion
You gotta wield it like a weapon (Weapon)
'Cause it does the Daedra well (Well)

[Verse 2]
Heads up, mortals, not much left of them
I got a pitch
Fork your souls over to Oblivion, they’ll entrap them
You meddlin' meager mortal dungeon diver, here's a snorkel
Cross dimensions with your portals
Where you'll bend your rules and morals
Playin' checkers, but the game is chess and it's rigged
So checkmate, atheists, I've made the price of penance your vig
And when you've met him, you'll see your debt manifested
With all this sin, you're infested
That he'll convince you you're blessed with (Ugh)

[Pre-Chorus]
What we had is fuckin' dead, no matter
I can get myself a necromancer
Lost the magic, guess we got low magicka
Follow me, 'cause all we really need is a little bit of—

[Chorus]
Aetherius (Aetherius) with a little bit of Oblivion
You gotta wield it like a weapon (Weapon)
'Cause it does the Daedra well (Well)
Just surrender me your Aetherius (Aetherius)
I'll give you the gift of Oblivion (Gift of Oblivion)
By the time the world is endin'
You'll know my Daedra all too well (Well)

[Verse 3]
History will repeat itself, better believe it if we meet in Oblivion
Where every Daedra should be dwelling
My Aedra just ain't gellin'
Upon my path divine, I'll watch evil pass his prime
With an ending so poetic that it practically rhymes
Abominations, oh, how our children have grown
Unfit to sit on the throne, molded from flesh and from bone
Do not forsake them
Listen, if you're not with me, Azura will help you to see
What we need is just a little bit of—

[Chorus]
Aetherius (Aetherius) with a little bit of Oblivion
You gotta wield it like a weapon (Weapon)
'Cause it does the Daedra well (Well)
Just surrender me your Aetherius (Aetherius)
I'll give you the gift of Oblivion (Gift of Oblivion)
By the time the world is endin'
You'll know my Daedra all too well (Well)
