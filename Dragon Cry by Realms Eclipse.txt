"Dragon Cry" by Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the proud times (wings stretched so wide)  
Our draconic might, we soared the sky  
But I'm falling apart (ancient echoes call)  
Time's grip on my fading heart

[Chorus]
My dragon cry, Dovahkiin will break and rend  
My dragon cry waiting for the end  
Just you and I, stay with me through time, my friend  
And we will keep the stars from falling through the scarlet sky

[Verse 2]
Down by the Throat they will find me (savage, defiled)  
This doom spreading inside me, wild  
I'm falling apart (I don't recognize this land)  
Time's grip on my fading heart

[Chorus]
My dragon cry, Dovahkiin will break and rend  
My dragon cry waiting for the end  
Just you and I, stay with me through time, my friend  
And we will keep the daedra from falling through with our dragon cry

[Bridge]
Out across the void, we rush  
Aetherius yields to us

[Verse 3]
Down in Nirn, he slumbers  
As I am torn asunder  
The hunger ever stronger  
Just let me taste, my honor lost

[Chorus]
My dragon cry, Dovahkiin will break and rend  
My dragon cry waiting for the end  
Just you and I, stay with me through time, my friend  
And we will keep the daedra from falling through with our dragon cry

[Outro]
Nordic steel  
The Dragonborn is closing in  
Out across the void, we rush  
Aetherius yields to us
