"This is for Cyrodiil" by Realms Eclipse

[Intro]
This is for Cyrodiil, Cyrodiil
This is for Cyrodiil, Cyrodiil

[Verse 1]
Everybody's seeking power
Building walls high in the name of Empire
Everybody's climbing towers
It's a long road, in the shadow of White-Gold Spire

[Pre-Chorus]
The meek will be strong
And the strong will be brave
The small will be great
In the heart of the Eight
Everybody's seeking power
But it's our time

[Chorus]
This is for Cyrodiil
Aetherius coming down to the heart of Tamriel
This is for Cyrodiil
Come alive in us, gonna light up this whole world
This is for Septim, Septim
To break off every chain
This is for Cyrodiil

[Verse 2]
Blessed are the bound and broken
You're a hero, and your deeds will prove it
Blessed are the warriors 
And the loyal, you'll be crowned as rulers

[Pre-Chorus]
The meek will be strong
And the strong will be brave
The small will be great
In the heart of the Eight

[Chorus]
This is for Cyrodiil
Aetherius coming down to the heart of Tamriel
This is for Cyrodiil
Come alive in us, gonna light up this whole world
This is for Septim, Septim
To break off every chain
This is for Cyrodiil

[Post-Chorus]
Forever (Forever), forever (Forever)
Everything else is gonna fade away
It stands forever (Forever), forever (Forever)
Everything else is gonna fade away
We stand together, together
One in heart, one in voice, one in Eight
It stands forever (Forever), forever (Forever)
Forever

[Bridge]
This is for Cyrodiil
This is for Cyrodiil, Cyrodiil (Oh)
This is for Cyrodiil

[Chorus]
This is for Cyrodiil
Aetherius coming down to the heart of Tamriel
This is for Cyrodiil
Come alive in us, gonna light up this whole world
This is for Septim, Septim
To break off every chain
This is for Cyrodiil
This is for Cyrodiil

[Outro]
This is for Cyrodiil, Cyrodiil
This is for Cyrodiil, Cyrodiil
