"Big Sword"
By: Realms Eclipse
[Verse 1]
To the town of Whiterun Hold
Rode a stranger one chill day
Hardly spoke to guards or merchants
Didn’t have too much to say
No one dared to ask his business
No one dared to draw or quip
The stranger there among them
Had a big sword on his hip
Big sword on his hip

[Verse 2]
It was early in the morning
When he came from Riverwood
He came walking, cloak was tattered
Face half-shadowed by his hood
“He’s a sellsword or a slayer,”
Came the whisper from each lip
“And he’s here to claim a bounty
With the big sword on his hip”
Big sword on his hip

[Verse 3]
In that hold there dwelled a warlord
By the name of Rurik Dread
Many knights had tried to fell him
Many knights now lie there dead
He was cruel and feared by nobles
Though he barely looked past youth
And the blood upon his greaves
Was a testament to truth
Testament to truth

[Verse 4]
Now the stranger gave his reason
In a voice both cold and clear
Was a Blade once in the service
But no longer bound by fear
He had come to slay a tyrant
Bring the rebel lord to ground
And he’d do it for no fortune—
Just to even what’s unbound
Even what’s unbound

[Verse 5]
Word was sent to Rurik Dreadnaught
But the lord just laughed it off
Men had come with blades and magic—
He had turned them all to broth
Thirty men had tried to face him
Thirty men had made a slip
Thirty-one would be the madman
With the big sword on his hip
Big sword on his hip

[Verse 6]
Soon the square was deathly silent
As the sun began to rise
It was just a breath past twilight
When they met with narrowed eyes
Villagers behind their shutters
Watched with hands on lips and heart
For they knew this grim-faced stranger
Came to tear their curse apart
Tear their curse apart

[Verse 7]
There were forty paces measured
When they stopped and raised their blades
And the speed of that old Blade-man
Still lives on in bardic praise
Rurik Dread swung hard with fury
But his strike was wild and slipped
And the stranger’s blade had sung once
From the big sword on his hip
Big sword on his hip

[Verse 8]
It was over in a heartbeat
As the frost fell on the ground
There lay Rurik, eyes still open
With no time to make a sound
Yes, he might have lived forever
But he made one fatal slip
When he challenged that lone warrior
With the big sword on his hip
Big sword on his hip

[Outro]
Big sword, big sword
When he challenged that lone warrior
With the big sword on his hip
Big sword on his hip
