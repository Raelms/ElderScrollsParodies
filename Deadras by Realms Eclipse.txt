"Daedras" by Realms Eclipse

Now that I got a quest
I think that I can't rest
For every second that I'm not saving Tamriel
But now I'm stuck at the gate
Of Oblivion's estate
I fell in love with a Daedra in a cell
Thinking about all the things
The way you pull my strings
I love the way you turn me on
I ain't Sheogorath, but I'm the Prince
I'd do anything
So that I could take you home

She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah

Ring around the city
Weapons are very deadly
I'ma fucking kill all the Daedra now
Ring around the city
Weapons are very deadly
I'ma fucking hail Mannimarco now
Ring around the city
Weapons are very deadly
I'ma fucking kill all the Daedra now
Ring around the city
Weapons are very deadly
I'ma fucking hail Mannimarco now

Now that I got a blade
I'm gonna devastate
I think that I am tripping off your spells
Started playing your games
You got me in a stalemate
Now you are the queen, and I'm enthralled
Thinking about all the things
The way you pull my strings
I love the way you turn me on
You're the queen, so let me be your knight
I'd do anything so that we could rule the realm

She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
She drove me, drove me crazy, yeah
