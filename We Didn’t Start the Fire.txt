"We Didn’t Start the Fire"
By: Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1 — Dawn Era & early Merethic]
Anu, Padomay
Aedra born and fade away
Magnus leaving, stars ignite
Lorkhan tricked them in the fight
Time began, Nirn was made
Ehlnofey, the Dawn betrayed
Aldmeris, myth and lore
Ayleid cities, Direnni war

[Instrumental Interlude]

Veloth’s path, Chimer flee
Boethiah eats Trinimac’s meat
Dwemer delve, Tonal lore
Altmer leave the Summerset shore
Ysgramor and Atmora’s ice
Return with vengeance, blood as price
Saarthal burns, Snow Elves fall
Shalidor writes the mighty wall

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning
Since the world’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it
But we tried to fight it

[Verse 2 — Late Merethic to Early First Era]
Heart of Lorkhan, Kagrenac
Numidium plans on Dwemer tracks
Five Companions, Wulfharth’s shout
Dwemer vanish, Blades spread out
Reman born in war and flame
Akaviri stake their claim
Redguards land from Yokuda
Alessian Reforms rule Tamriel

Direnni Tower, Potentate
Almalexia seals her fate
Nerevar at Red Mountain slain
Tribunal gods begin their reign
Mannimarco, Soul Trap
Worm King with his black staff
Tiber Septim, Numid’s might
Brings the world to Empire’s height

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning
Since the wheel’s been returning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it
But we tried to fight it

[Verse 3 — Mid to Late First Era]
Orcish strongholds, Orsinium falls
Saint Alessia, shrines and halls
Rada al-Saran, Greymoor keep
Dragons rise and Dragons sleep
Aetherius, stars align
Ayleid gems and Welkynd shine
Tharn’s betrayal, blades unsheathed
Pelinal cries in savage grief

Wulfharth, Stormcrown, war resumes
Reymon unites Colovian tombs
Tsaesci blades, a serpent sting
Reman’s Empire starts to cling
Clavicus, Nocturnal, schemes
Mystic Archives, seers and dreams
Imperial City, White-Gold Throne
Nibenay and West unsewn

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning
Since the world’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it
But we tried to fight it

[Verse 4 — Second Era]
Akatosh Pact, dragons chained
Molag Bal and Coldharbour's reign
Soulburst, Anchors fall
Varen hides in Sancre Tor's wall
Three Banners, war begins
Altmer, Pact, and Dagger pins
Daggerfall and Wayrest clash
Bosmer bark and Dunmer ash

Barenziah, Tribunal fake
Sotha Sil, the deals he makes
Imperial throne is left to fall
Vivec floats in ghostly thrall
Psijics vanish, mystic guild
Telvanni towers slowly build
Niben warlords stake their claim
Tharn returns to play his game

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning
Since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it
But we tried to fight it

[Verse 5 — End of Second Era]
Tiber storms from Alcaire
Numidium awakened there
Talos shouts, breaks the sky
Mantella forged, stars reply
Battlespire, Daedra wars
Mehrunes plots behind his doors
Empire forged, crowned in flame
End of chaos, start of name

Dragonfires, blood divine
Amulet and sacred line
Septim’s rise, Tribunal fades
Vvardenfell beneath ash-blades
Nerevarine, myth returned
Dagoth Ur and mountains burned
From Dawn to dusk, we still aspire
Living in the Elder Fire

[Final Chorus & Outro]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning
Since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it
But we tried to fight it
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning
Since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
But when we are gone
It will still burn on, and on, and on...

We didn’t start the fire...
