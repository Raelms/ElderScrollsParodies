"A Little Delving" by Realms Eclipse

Boot up your computer, launch the game where legends reside
From Skyrim’s frosty mountains to Morrowind’s strange, fungal spires
It could be Cyrodiil’s green pastures, or Daggerfall’s sprawling confines
In Tamriel’s deep lore, you’ll be amazed at the secrets you’ll find
Inside these Elder Scrolls, behind the game’s bright sheen
There’s so much to uncover, a history between
The epic battles and quests, magic, gods, and the lore
We’ve got Daedric Princes to explore, plus so much more
How did the Dwemer go? Who killed Pelinal though?
Nirnroot’s eerie glow, why does it always grow?
Have you dived deep into the Scrolls?
How does the Thu’um echo? What did Vivec bestow?
You’ll never guess what happened to the island of Yokuda, yo

In every dragon you defeat and each Daedric plot you unseat
With each quest completed, the lore becomes a bit more replete
And with each ancient text found and every prophecy you resolve
We find a new way to see the world in which we revolve
These games have secrets inside and
As a team, we can find them
You’ve a blank page and a clear horizon
So why not do a little delving?
I think it’s time we did a little delving

It’s a whole lot of research and the Scrolls keep piling up
But you’re not a mere adventurer, you’re already wise enough
So sit back and grab a skooma or a flagon of honey mead
And ponder how you might survive a trip to Apocrypha’s seas
Build a guild from the ground, from the Thieves to the Mage’s pride
Think you’ll find peace in Sovngarde or take a Daedra’s side?
Get the lore just right, or a Nirncrux will divide
Then it’s still more baffling than Jyggalag’s intricate mind
Artifacts, Pelinal's Wrath
Keeping your Companions on the path
How the Red Mountain lasts
And we all know that Sheogorath's mad!
Never had I thought of Alduin eating the world
Or the secret pasts of every Dragonborn girl
Volcanic eruption, Clockwork City's construction
The horror that is Molag Bal’s abduction
The mystery of the Psijic Order, the Knights of the Nine’s borders
Just why was Talos a god? A million other questions
You may gain a wealth of knowledge
But not even Hermaeus Mora holds them all

In every dragon you defeat and each Daedric plot you unseat
With each quest completed, the lore becomes a bit more replete
And with each ancient text found and every prophecy you resolve
We find a new way to see the world in which we revolve
These games have secrets inside and
As a team, we can find them
You’ve a blank page and a clear horizon
So why not do a little delving?

But we’re not contained to one province, there’s more to explore
Will you face the Tribunal gods or dive into Argonia’s lore?
When navigating Oblivion, how will you close the door?
And five pro-strats for surviving Mehrunes Dagon’s roar
The cannibalism of the Bosmer in their sacred green
The mysteries of Yokudan sword-singing and their lost schemes
Impractical enchantments of the Dwemer machines
Or the best potion concoctions with alchemical dreams
If everyone together casts all spells and a half
We’d add the duration and map them on a graph
You’d see we don’t need Divayth Fyr here for learning what lasts
It’s clever but never forget, we’re having a delight
And we’ll do a lot of learning on the way
The gears are always churning so just turn another page
Whoever said that work should be impervious to play
Never learned to peek behind the curtain of an Elder Scrolls games
A curious community is spinning the globe
You could join us too, but it’s a confusing slope
I’m addicted, so I think I’ll pick theories we wrote
Then I’ll wrap them with a bow and give it to Talos
