"In A Perfect Nirn" by Realms Eclipse

For the flaw that you are in my vision
You're a part of our myth and tradition
This infection of light fused with dark
Now my power can finally spark (now my power can finally spark)

You wanna stick it to Daedra? Did they rile you up?
Are you sick of their meddling? Want some stars to disrupt?
I got a gem on my shoulder, but my mind is clear
Worship too many false gods, I'm the one you should fear
I'ma take the power back that Azura has got
She monopolized the dusk and dawn, because why the fuck not?
To wage a war on her dreams, I need more time on the clock
My rage against her scheme, means that my vitals are shocked
When I was hit with her vision, had my destiny rocked
I guess I'll kindly pick up a blade, and fight 'til I'm caught
But you can count me out because I'm tapped in
There ain't a realm in Oblivion I can't step in
I'm no fan of her moon and star, that's Azura's sign
But now I gotta break her hold, so would you if you were mine
She's not a god, but she was dropped on us like fate
I gotta stop her ascension before it's too late
Because if not, it's all for naught, if I die in shame
She'll be pulling puppet strings from inside my brain
She's messing with my head, better weaponize the pain
Because you know I'm here to revolutionize the game

In a perfect nirn
I'm the one ruling you
I'm a perfect girl
Ain't no wrong I can do

Am I a mortal soul, first of my phenomena?
A man or a daedroth? I thought I was one of 'em
Maybe it's a case of fate vs. magicka
But I'm still leading half a life, at least I'm not a follower (follower)
Pardon me, I thought I'd do a little soul scan
I've found no gods or kings, besides Azura's hand
Every trope of Nirn turned upside down
But now you'll get the boot because I gotta shut ya down

For the flaw that you are in my vision
You're a part of our myth and tradition
Your whole life is no more than a whisper
Join my flock and with godship be richer

Don't agree to her terms, don't believe in that voice
Just because it's your turn, doesn't mean it's your choice
Slap a ward on my spirit, gotta fight off the curse
That she's got in her words, a spell I can't reverse
I think I've been here before, because I know my quests
Anytime I need a sign, I go with dusk and dawn
Is this a citadel, or tell me is it hell?
You wrote the prophecy, but I'm living it well

In a perfect nirn
I'm the one ruling you
I'm a perfect girl
Ain't no wrong I can do (I can do, I can do)
