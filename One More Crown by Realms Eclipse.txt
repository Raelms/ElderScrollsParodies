"One More Crown" by Realms Eclipse

[Intro]
Golden light, why don't you shine down on me
You never shine on me, you never shine on-

[Verse 1]
Another update
Patch note notification
It's ZeniMax calling
New crown store temptations
Four new mounts daily
And costumes for celebrations
It's taking five minutes, right?
Oh no, it’s almost night

[Verse 2]
But I can't take any rest until I finish this quest
Gotta do this by tomorrow else I miss the event
And I be skipping cutscenes, guess I'll figure the rest
Until I finally come to witness some familiar chest
I'm finding every rune 'cause you’re the best out there
Riding through the air, I can’t help but stare
Breaking out my dreams to Oblivion I swear
Now the only thing I care about’s this golden glare

[Pre-Chorus]
Golden light, why don't you shine down on me
You never shine on me, you never shine on
ZeniMax, your treasures are all I see
You never shine on me
But I keep buying

[Chorus]
Just one more crown
Not gonna hurt
Just one more crown
Dig in the dirt
A treasure trove
Of rusty swords
Need one more crown
Just one more (One more!)

Just one more crown
And she comes home
Just one more crown
Or a ten pack
Retirement savings
Are mostly gone
For one more crown
Just one more (One more!)

[Verse 3]
She says I'm the chosen
I've maxed out Tamriel
She's waiting, so frozen
I’m still stuck in a delve
The sale is ending
And I keep getting baited
(Tamriel skies are merciless)
So when’s the next discount?

[Verse 4]
Every dungeon dive just to make you mine
Completed quests in Summerset (It makes no sense)
Done the content all left behind
'Cause there's not much new at level sixty-nine (I’m so tense)
Gonna carry my team and my peace of mind
She be blessing my eyes when I see her climb (Will this end?)
I got skill points plenty but no time to grind
'Cause the only thing I’m hoping for's that golden shine

[Pre-Chorus]
Golden light, why don't you shine down on me
You never shine on me, you never shine on
ZeniMax, I'm sick of your guarantees
You never shine on me
But I keep buying

[Chorus]
Just one more crown
Not gonna hurt
Just one more crown
Dig in the dirt
A treasure trove
Of useless swords
Need one more crown
Just one more (Just one more crown)

[Post-Chorus]
Wet status you applied on me (Just one more crown)
So long, Auridon, goodbye Elsweyr (Just one more crown)
Golden light, you're finally here! (She's coming home)
(Spoken) Is it just a cat?!
(Yeah, mmm, well just try harder next year)

[Outro]
Daggerfall, Vvardenfell
I can't take it anymore
You never shine on me, you never shine on
Stormhaven, Craglorn, Rivenspire
Final crown, final straw
You have a guarantee
So just keep buying (Just one more crown)
Coldharbour, Alik’r Desert
I can't take it anymore (Just one more crown)
You never shine on me, you never shine on
Reaper’s March, Eastmarch too
I got better things to do (She's coming home)
You have a guarantee (Just one more)
So just keep buying (Just one more crown)
You never shine on me
But I keep buying
