"Don't Hold Your Breath" by Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1]
After the landin', on Tamriel's sandin'  
The Nord king's standin' with 500 companions  
I said to myself, ain't gonna hold my breath  
Waitin' around for death, now that my axe is planted  
Add the fact our ships have been damaged  
I've never been the handiest combatant  
I'd better gather men and get to planning  
Loss of our homeland? Try not to panic!  
Transmit an emergency rally message  
I suspect no other Nords will get it  
Guess I'll get this fortress expandin'  
Call me Ysgramor, the tale is branded  
Our legacy will be gigantic  
Except there ain't no bards directin'  
Remember the past, when elves did damage?  
Forget that shit, we callin' action

Now march - into the depths  
An immeasurable, endless conquest  
This isn't peace, but I'll stick to our vengeance  
Strength is your deadliest weapon  
Never fathomed all the caverns  
That this land's eclectic life inhabits  
Better have your wits about you  
Don't neglect your shield and axe practice  
Yeah, ever since I've descended  
I've been breathless, pun-intended  
That might be a side effect of leadin' so fast  
Cuz I'm getting rather lightheaded  
I'm knockin' objectives off my checklist  
Found a couple of ruins in the wreckage  
Everybody else already met their death  
Rest In Peace, at least some relics collected  
Can you sense any elven presence?  
Who left these ancient traps and passages?  
Could they have vanished when we landed?  
Will my questions ever be answered?  
Potential threat - make an assessment  
I am gonna bet it's aggressive  
My energy levels are precious  
I'm not in my element, I feel defenseless

[Chorus]
There is no one left  
In these open depths  
You're at your own behest  
So don't hold your breath

[Verse 2]
Headfirst I'll be divin' in  
Makin' tidal waves like a dragonkin  
Apex predator - you bet I am him  
Top of the food chain is where I will sit  
Got an appetite for any elven kin  
Grilled venison's quite an energizing dish  
Add a Nordic ale on the side with it  
Even Sovngarde might say "I'm impressed"  
I collect ebony, quicksilver, and gems  
Gold, silver, and any diamond I can get  
Save the soul gems, enchantments are dyin' man  
Unless you really like to win  
Skeever bite me, frostbite spider behind me  
Every troll is tryin' to terrify me  
I guess they like me, but I can't blame 'em  
I'm giving off vibes like devastation  
Don't you forget about hydration  
Need bottle of ale? Try to make one  
Get your hands on a healing potion  
I've never seen creatures as savage as this  
What's that? Half a wolf and half a bear?  
Shocked that I haven't seen a dragon yet  
But I'd believe if that exists  
Giants are known to roam these Nordic pits

Burden's getting heavy  
Power's about to be empty  
I love my shield, but it won't protect me  
Not from the enemies that I have seen  
I just saw Hircine - didn't affect me  
At least not till I was in neck-deep  
I'll freak out if I see another damn wraith  
You can't breathe here, but you can scream

[Chorus]
There is no one left  
In these open depths  
You're at your own behest  
So don't hold your breath  
There is no one left  
In these open depths  
You're at your own behest  
So don't hold your breath

[Bridge]
Echoes of beasts surround me  
But I won't abandon the mission  
Loneliness feels like drowning  
I'm slowly losing my vision

Keep going deeper, leave Altmora behind  
The land has me reeling, my life's on the line  
Heart beating, I'm breathing then I'm still alive  
So take one more stride

[Chorus]
There is no one left  
In these open depths  
You're at your own behest  
So don't hold your breath

There is no one left  
In these open depths  
You're at your own behest  
So don't hold your breath
