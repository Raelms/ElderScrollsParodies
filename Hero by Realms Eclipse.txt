"Hero" by Realms Eclipse

Well, I remember what you told me  
Said Todd was unholy  
So, Talos, can you point me to E3 2017
And I still keep it with me  
Tucked under all the memories  
Your thu'um echoing throughout those trees  

And through all stormy weather  
And holes in the leather  
These boots still covered in mud  
Well, I'm still praying to the Divines  
And hoping for the signs 
But hope only gets a hero so far when  

This game of life weighs heavy on my heart and  
Alduin is tough, but Miraak is twice as hard and  
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go  
And they say pressure makes legends, how in Oblivion am I still a hero?

Now I've seen Sovngarde without dying  
Met the Daedra without trying  
And they both seem to wanna talk to me  
But I'm all outta perks now  
And my dreams aren't worth a septim  
It's tough tryin' to land on my feet when  

This game of life weighs heavy on my heart and  
Alduin is tough, but Miraak is twice as hard and  
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go  
And they say pressure makes legends, how in Oblivion am I still a hero?

When every day is almost over  
Since that day in 3E 433
When you told me Cyrodill was on fire, so I left  
'Cause if you need me, well, I told ya  
I'm on the better side of skooma
Tryin' to find a four-leaf clover  
To get me out of this mess  

This game of life weighs heavy on my heart and  
Alduin is tough, but Miraak is twice as hard and  
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go  
And they say pressure makes legends, how in Oblivion 
This game of life weighs heavy on my heart and  
Alduin is tough, but Miraak is twice as hard and  
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go  
And they say pressure makes legends, how in Oblivion am I still a hero?
