"Immortal" by Realms Eclipse

These Mancers are singing
With the chanting and stabbing
'Neath the red candle lights

Saccharine cacophany
That masks the living screaming
It hides their cries

Mortals never listen
When they're told it's rude to stare
Always causing problems
'Til you cut their heart out bare
Now they see Tamriel
Through rotting undying eyes

Made to entertain, the blood sacrifices
Made from the Daedra design

Flawless execution and a great solution
To my Master's crime

Mortals never listen
annoying like a slaughterfish
Always causing problems
'Til you make them bleed outright
Surprising and concerning
To think there's a ritual inside!

Cut them down to forge forever
We'll ignite with lifelines severed
In potential lies endless life awoken

Damn them to their final verdict
Give their life to the deserving
Let their remnants cry
I remain immortal!

Believe everything you hear from Molag Bal
The sweet nothings behind his corrupted smile

Tales of souls and heavens that'll be good
If they just follow and be dead a while

Mortals never listen
Should be killed and never learned
Always screaming out
Until you get them burned
Though lies i deceive everyone
All for a low price of a septim

Cut them down to forge forever
We'll ignite with lifelines severed
In potential lies endless life awoken
Damn them to their final verdict
Give their life to the deserving
Let their remnants cry
I remain immortal!

The sweetness of being immortal
Taken from all the mortals
While they cry a lot on forums
I feed on my betrayal of Bal

It's so clear to me
In my immortality
That a title shall belong to me!

Cut them down to forge forever
We'll ignite with lifelines severed
In potential lies endless life awoken

Damn them to their final verdict
Give their life to the deserving
Let their remnants cry
This perfection, his design
For a Manacer, for all time
Will remain immortal!

The world has been deprived
Of true artists, for too long

If I can't have my perfect little ending, well
Now ill have plenty of time, to make a confusing one
