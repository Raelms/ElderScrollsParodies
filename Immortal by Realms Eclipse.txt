"Unbroken" by Realms Eclipse

These Tombs Are Ringing
With The Wailing And The Screaming
'Neath Cold Ayleid Light
Arcane Incantation
Hides My Profaned Creation
Beyond Mortal Sight
Mortals Never Listen
When They're Warned To Not Defy
Always Seeking Power
'Til They’re Mummified Alive
Now They Haunt The World
With Cold, Unblinking, Soulless Eyes
Made To Serve In Death, Reanimated Perfection
Crafted From Design
Flawless Incantation, Everlasting Undeath Nation
My Grand Paradigm
Mortals Never Listen
Tearing Through With Greed And Might
Always Seeking Secrets
'Til They’re Bound In Bone And Blight
Outrageous And Audacious
To Think They Deserved This Life
Cut Them Down To Raise Forever
We'll Ignite With Souls Unfettered
In Corruption, There Lies Power Unspoken
Damn Them To My Final Verdict
Give Their Flesh To The Deserving
Let Their Ghosts All Cry
I Remain Unbroken

Believe Everything You Hear From Me
The Sweet Whispers Cloaked In Ebony Lies
Tales Of Peace And Grace If They Bend The Knee
While Their Kin Wail As Their Essence Dies
Mortals Never Listen
Should Be Ruled And Never Heard
Always Fearing Death
Until They’re Trapped Inside A Word
Through Lies I Get New Life
All For The Price Of A Soul’s Worth
Cut Them Down To Raise Forever
We'll Ignite With Souls Unfettered
In Corruption, There Lies Power Unspoken
Damn Them To My Final Verdict
Give Their Flesh To The Deserving
Let Their Ghosts All Cry
I Remain Unbroken

The Sweetness Of Death Eternal
Claimed From Fools Who Dream They’re Worthy
While They Rot In Tombs Infernal
I Feast On The Ghost In Every Scream
It’s So Clear To Me
In My Necromancy
That A Worm’s Great Name Shall Be Forever

Cut Them Down To Raise Forever
We'll Ignite With Souls Unfettered
In Corruption, There Lies Power Unspoken
Damn Them To My Final Verdict
Give Their Flesh To The Deserving
Let Their Ghosts All Cry
This Perfection, My Design
For A Worm, Beyond All Time
Will Remain… Unbroken

The world has forgotten its true masters...
But I shall remind them—bone by bone.
If the living won't serve me...
Then I shall make my own.
