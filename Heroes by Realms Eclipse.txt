"Heroes" by Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1: Morrowind]
What are you willing to lose?
You cover your wounds, but underneath them
A million voices in your head that whisper, "Dagoth"
Another twist of the knife, turn of the screws
It's all in your mind and it's fighting you
Arm yourself, a storm is coming
Well, Nerevarine, what you gonna do now?
It's your reflection looking back to pull you down

[Chorus]
So are you gonna die today or make it out alive?
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
Fly, Nerevar, fly
It's time for a new empire
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
Nerevar, fly

[Verse 2: Oblivion]
And now you're playing with matches
Come out of the ashes underneath you
A million voices in the crowd they're screaming, "Daedra"
We'll let 'em swallow their pride, you're turning the tide to true believers
Got them in the palm of your hand, you're saving Tamriel now
What you gonna do now?
It's your reflection looking back to pull you down

[Chorus]
So are you gonna die today or make it out alive?
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
Fly, Champion, fly
It's time for a new empire
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
Champion, fly

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
So are you gonna die today or make it out alive?
You gotta conquer the monster in your head and then you'll fly
Fly, hero, fly
It's time for a new empire
Go bury your demons then tear down the ceiling
Hero, fly
