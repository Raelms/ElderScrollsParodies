"My Prophecy Know What You Did In Vvardenfell" by Realms Eclipse

[Intro]
(Hands, put your hands, hands, put your hands in the air)
(Hands, put your hands, hands, put your hands in the air)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
In Morrowind, they might just hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing Dagoth Ur apart
I'm in the Sixth House with the devil
You know, Vivec could never get me on his level
I just gotta get you out of Red Mountain’s cage, I'm a young Azura’s rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite

[Pre-Chorus]
But my prophecy know what you did in Vvardenfell

[Chorus]
So cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Spell Failing 
So cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Spell Failing 
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Morrowind, wind
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Morrowind, wind

[Verse 2]
Well all the Telvanni keep writing what they write
Somewhere another mage just died (Died)
I've got the scars from the Tribunal and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to Dagoth Ur except for me
Through a constellation of stars on your map
Burn everything you love then burn the Ashlands
In the end everything collides, my past lives
Spat back out the Nerevarine that you see

[Pre-Chorus]
My prophecy know what you did in Vvardenfell

[Chorus]
So cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Spell Failing 
So cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Spell Failing 
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Morrowind, wind
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Morrowind, wind

[Interlude]
Hands, put your hands, hands, hands in the air (Left, left, left, right, left)
Hands, put your hands, hands, hands in the air (Left, left, left, right, left)

[Pre-Chorus]
My prophecy know what you did in Vvardenfell
(My prophecy know what you did in Vvardenfell)

[Chorus]
So cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Spell Failing 
So cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Cast 'em up, up, up
Spell Failing 
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Morrowind, wind
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
In Morrowind, wind
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
