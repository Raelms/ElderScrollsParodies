"We Didn't Start the Fire"
By: Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1 – Late Third Era]
Dagoth Ur, Red Mountain,
Nerevarine comes again
Corpus, Sixth House
Ghostgate, Tribunal down
Azura’s prophecy
Wabbajack, Pelagius
Barenziah, Vivec gone
Morag Tong, assassins on
Cliff Racers, Sotha Sil
Black Horse Courier
Jagar Tharn, Shadow War
Mythic Dawn, Mehrunes Dagon
Oblivion, Kvatch burns
Martin Septim, dragon form
Daedra, planes collide
Amulet, the Septims die

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it but we’re trying to fight it

[Verse 2 – End of 3E to early 4E]
Thalmor, White-Gold
Titus Mede takes control
Red Ring, Valenwood
Stormcrown rises as he should
Vivec gone, Baar Dau
Red Year, Morrowind wow
Argonian invasion
Dres fall, liberation
High King, Solitude
Emperor in a bloody feud
Throat of the World, Greybeards
Dragons back, shouts are heard
Paarthurnax, Alduin
End of time begins again
Scrolls foretold, Sovngarde
Skyrim breaks and civil wars

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it but we’re trying to fight it

[Verse 3 – Skyrim Events & 4E chaos]
Stormcloaks, Ulfric’s cry
Talos worship banned, why?
Markarth, Silver-Bloods
Vampire Lords draw first blood
Dark Brotherhood, Black Hand
Astrid’s plans go out of hand
Dragonborn, Miraak returns
Hermaeus in Apocrypha churns
White-Gold Concordat
Empire’s peace falls flat
Penitus Oculatus
Blades disbanded, no one trusts
Elder Scroll, Time-Wound
Alduin comes crashing down
Solstheim, Ash Spawn
Hircine’s Hunt, Bloodmoon dawn

[Chorus]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
No, we didn’t light it but we’re trying to fight it

[Verse 4 – Late 4E and aftermath]
Night Mother whispers back
Thalmor knives behind their backs
Summerset closed its doors
Yokudan sword-saints war
Malacath, Orsinium
Rise and fall of stronghold kin
Snow Elves, betrayed race
Falmer crawl beneath the waste
Blackreach, Elder lore
Dwemer gone forevermore
Cicero and madness grows
Shadows in the Lantern glow
Numidium’s legacy
Who decides reality?
Wheel breaks, towers fall
What else do I have to call?

[Chorus – Finale]
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning since the wheel’s been turning
We didn’t start the fire
But when we are gone
It will still go on, and on, and on
And on, and on, and on, and on, and on
We didn’t start the fire
It was always burning since the wheel’s been turning
