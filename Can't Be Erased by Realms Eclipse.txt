"Can't Be Erased" by Realms Eclipse

[Intro]
I'm the Mad God Sheogorath
Watch me twirl and hop and spin
I'll laugh as you go mad
Let chaos now begin
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahaha, hahaha
Hahahaha, hahahaha, hahahahahaha

[Refrain]
Hahahahahaha, the wonders of dementia
Welcome home, dear mortal
Madness' true magenta
Let’s create insanity
Breathe life into your screams
All you gotta do is eat this cheese

[Verse 1]
I'm the Prince of Madness, whose chaos brings delight
Upon this Shivering Isle, imagination takes its flight
Just free yourself from reason
Soon, you'll see in colors bright
Call me a seed of chaos
But what's that mean if I’m conceived within your mind?
Cheese is in the ceiling, madness seeping through the lines
Is that your sanity that's slipping or an illusion that survives?
Collect what's necessary, keep pleasing the divine
It's me you should be heeding
Because Jyggalag deceives with lies

[Verse 2]
Holy hysteria, has it been centuries? (No way)
It appears the Greymarch might have reappeared (Oh, what?)
Lifeless, dreary thoughts I have learned to steer
Kinda reminds me why I rule in here
Uh, why did you come? Lemme guess, woes
You should be leaving (Help me)
Whatever happens, you’re mine to show
What are these Daedra? (No, no, no)
Guess if you gotta be stuck here
Then you might as well celebrate
Madness is unlocking, but too bad your exit’s fake

[Pre-Chorus]
Despite this mask of madness
I hide in sheer delight
The world may be your canvas
But your mind is now my sight
The staff is mightier than the sword, it has no limitation
Don't refrain, this realm of pain
And nothing can erase us now
Can you describe the face you saw?
Could it be one you recognize?
You'd never harm the hand that draws
Madness cursed you all with life

[Chorus]
Shamed and disgraced, lost in this place
Tainted by chaos and can't be erased
Mortal minds betrayed us, we've got it on tape
We've written your fate and it can't be erased

[Post-Chorus]
(Can't be erased)
(Can't be erased)

[Verse 3]
I was not always this mad, once I was a simple muse
Imagination made me stronger, but that power was confused
The Madness is growing, the realm is flowing
Now you need to run because Sheogorath’s showing
Ah, ah, I really need help, someone send a dram
I'm surrounded by upside-down buttered lamb
I don't have a guide, just a little bit of lunar light
With a staff that I don't know how to handle right
Yo, look, that little Daedra darling's on a lot of reels
Long as he’s on one, he cannot be real
Stop the madness, Jyggalag’s revealed
Got a feeling he and I had a deal
An unholy bargain, a chaotic seal
With a master plan, that I must conceal
Won't be long 'til this realm’s all revealed
Upon my body, head to toe, all concealed (Ah!)
But a little bit of cheese should do the trick
I'll never be another damn mortal, I quit
"Look at you, you're scared of a Mad God’s wit"
Hey, mortal, how'd you get that madness to fit? (Hahahaha)

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm blinded by this madness growing
My heart is full of chaos loathing
With secrets that I keep from showing
I am the wolf in sheepish clothing
Flood the realm with madness flowing
Push it to the brink of blowing
We hope you don't think of going
Weigh you down to keep from floating
Come with me, we'll bring you gory
You'll be kept from being lonely
Kicking, screaming, sinking slowly
Give your soul, it's what you owe me

[Chorus]
Shamed and disgraced, lost in this place
Tainted by chaos and can't be erased
Mortal minds betrayed us, we've got it on tape
We've written your fate and it can't be erased

[Outro]
I'm the Mad God Sheogorath
Watch me twirl and hop and spin (Can't be erased)
I'll laugh as you go mad
Let chaos now begin (Can't be erased)
I'm the Mad God Sheogorath
Watch me twirl and hop and spin (Can't be erased)
I'll laugh as you go mad
Let chaos now begin (Can't be erased)
