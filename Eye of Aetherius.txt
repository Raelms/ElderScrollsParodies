"Eye of Aetherius"
By: Realms Eclipse
Based on the events of The Red Year

[Chorus]
(Heave ho!)
When the sky is burning
(Heave ho!)
Ash falls every morn
(Heave ho!)
The Divines stopped turning
Children of dusk
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius

[Verse 1]
Crack the earth, break the sky
Vvardenfell lies shattered
Ghosts of kin, can't begin
To count the lives that scattered

[Pre-Chorus]
With soul and spirit heavy
Can’t mend a fate so torn
We’re praying that the gods still mourn

[Chorus]
(Heave ho!)
When the sky is burning
(Heave ho!)
Ash falls every morn
(Heave ho!)
The Divines stopped turning
Children of dusk
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius

[Verse 2]
Moonlet fall, Tribunal lied
Worshiped gods now broken
Crimson rain, cursed terrain
And no apologies spoken

[Pre-Chorus]
With soul and spirit heavy
This silence deaf and wide
We begged the stars, but they just died

[Chorus]
(Heave ho!)
When the sky is burning
(Heave ho!)
Ash falls every morn
(Heave ho!)
The Divines stopped turning
Children of dusk
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius

[Bridge]
It’s the clearest of silence
If you don’t hear the screams
How many dreams will crumble
‘Til we drown beneath our broken schemes?

[(Instrumental - Lute / Drum Solo)]

[Chorus]
Oh!
(Heave ho!)
When the sky is burning
(Heave ho!)
Ash falls every morn
(Heave ho!)
The Divines stopped turning
Children of dusk
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius

[Outro]
(Heave ho!)
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
(Heave ho!)
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius
(Heave ho!)
Lost in the Eye of Aetherius
