"Shivering Isles domain" by Realms Eclipse

[Verse 1]
May I introduce you to
The world's most lunatic zoo
For everything you wish was make-believe?
Oh, mortal, did you know
You could sip tea with a Daedra?
If you wanna take that dare, Sheogorath
Might just steal your mind, so beware (So beware)

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me give you a scenario
And don't you tell a soul
It's only hypothetical

[Chorus]
Imagine all your nightmares
Contained in a twisted, madman's purgatory
Where sanity is in doubt
Straight thoughts have all worn out
Madness, mayhem celebrated
If it don't make any sense, like it's something in a story
We'll make sure it stays insane
In our Shivering Isles domain

[Verse 2]
Cheese unlike any other (Any other)
Mushroom tea that warps your mind like no other (Like no other)
All that we display will twist your belief
But mortal, don't you know
We don't wanna let reality (Wanna let reality)
Rear its boring head, it's a formality (Formality)
We control, twist, mend
So you don't live in sane

[Bridge]
Did I even mention
The creatures that reside?
Where do I begin? Where do I begin?
â€˜Cause there are more than ninety-nine (More than ninety-nine)
Golden Saints, Dark Seducers
Flesh Atronach, Gnarl uprooters
Madmen, Mania, Dementia's plight
Haskill's stare, all through the night
Unicorn, Elytra, Sky's Rain
Madgod's whim, your mind's in pain
Golden Gardens, Demented Fields
Madness blooms, reality yields
And that isn't even half of it

[Pre-Chorus]
So let me give you a scenario
Don't you tell a soul
It's only hypothetical (It's only hypothetical)
Let me give you a scenario
But don't you go thinking it's real

[Chorus]
Imagine all your nightmares
Contained in a twisted, madman's purgatory
Where sanity is in doubt
Straight thoughts have all worn out
Madness, mayhem celebrated
If it don't make any sense, like it's something in a story
We'll make sure it stays insane
In our Shivering Isles domain

[Outro]
Shivering Isles domain
Shivering Isles domain
(Shivering, shivering, shivering Isles domain)
