"Welcome to My Oblivion" by Realms Eclipse


[Intro]
Sweet child of mine, you're Dovahkiin
Nobody's on your level
This path of the Thu'um you're walking is
A long road to your oblivion 
(Welcome to my oblivion x4)

[Verse 1]
That's the sound of our fate
Dragons awake, so get out of its wake
Pull your armor and blade out of its case
All the hours I've waited, been countin' the days
I finally found my way out of this cave
Now look at the town, to the ground it was razed
Skyrim, I'm back, but I doubt you're the same
Alduin's wrath falls out of the sky
I'm covered in blood, screaming "Sovngarde awaits"
Dragon's fire came down like the rain
I'll shout till my lungs are drained of their breath
'Cuz when I go down I'll go down with a bang
How many foes are down to be slain?
I'll make you my thralls - bound in these chains
All of these cowards are shouting my name
As I rise from the ground, like a god unrestrained
I'm all that remains
Guess I'm a legend
But when I was stepping out, on this new quest and
I barely remembered the way that I left it
I never expected this world was so restless
Survival's a lesson
That's why I'm profession
The dragonborn living by shouts as my weapon
I customize every kind that I'm gettin'
Already in war, got no time for confession
We'll set sail for redemption
Solitude - we'll defend it
And if blood is spilt on Whiterun's hill
The fires of war will cleanse it
All on my own, so many of them
No wonder why I'm addicted to them
Friends that I've lost - I'll never forget
Now kick up the action - give me some skooma

[Hook]
I don't wanna set the world on fire
Just wanna start a flame in your heart
I don't wanna set the world on fire
I only wanna tear it apart
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion

[Verse 2]
Grab a mead for the gold, man
Where the sweetrolls? Let me at them
I got no shame looting trash cans
Make a bigger mess than a giant's slam
Gotta get rid of my insanity, shit
Locked door cracked - granted access
Shooting skeevers just for practice
If you got loot, let me have it
'Cuz I'm building a homestead
A place I can settle
A roof on my head and a bed is essential
Like hell you can get on my level
Don't ever forget that they said that I was Dovahkiin
Next stop, You can get off
On the cart where the heads roll
If you've been detected by a frost troll:
Shout out - FUS RO DAH
No sweat, threat gone
Just another target to check off
Generation fighting, our defense strong
Even better than any Thalmor
I'm the dragonborn you put bets on
No strikeouts - got the best luck
Every blood dragon's gonna get swatted
Knock 'em outta the sky - dovah!
Head to High Hrothgar - you can catch one
Alduin? Come and get some!

[Hook]
I don't wanna set the world on fire
Just wanna start a flame in your heart
I don't wanna set the world on fire
I only wanna tear it apart
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion

[Bridge]
My fire is radiating
Come feel this warmth of mine
These open arms are waiting
Take you away to oblivion

[Verse 3]
Could this all be a dream?
This ain't the Skyrim I wanted to see
All of these holds are not what they seem
Meant to protect us they kept us from seeing
I'll know that I'll get to the bottom though
I pass every test, like I am called the G.O.A.T
Got a lot of knowledge after all I've read
Screw the robes, I'm not a greybeard
It's a wasteland but it's got perks
Like my follower Lydia
Help me out when I'm over-encumbered
'That's a fine dragon that you've killed sir!'
Downtown Windhelm a massacre
On the food chain we're just scavengers
Got the frostbite making matters worse
Ice wraiths with a chilling curse
Check my shouts, got the best Thu'um
Hit you with a spell when I'm in the room
Nice Airship, I won't miss that
The percentage says that I can hit that
I'm just as fly with my wings on
Now revere me - time to kiss ass
That's right draugr - better get back
I'll go through you quicker than a health draught
Welcome to Tamriel
Full of radiant places
Not the land of the free
Where the home of the slave is
I pray that my children
Get the world I was raised in
I know things ain't the same
But war never changes

[Hook]
I don't wanna set the world on fire
Just wanna start a flame in your heart
I don't wanna set the world on fire
I only wanna tear it apart
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
Welcome to my oblivion
