"Welcome to Vvardenfell" by Realms Eclipse

Woke up with a headache but I wasn't hungover
Just got off a slave ship
What better way to wake up sober
They told me the prophecy's rigged
I never had the look of a hero
What happens in Vvardenfell stays, but in my case
I'm getting closure started from the bottom
And I'm talkin' Seyda Neen
Left for dead in the swamp, know what I mean?
That Tribunal I can never forget
Thanks for the scrolls Divayth
But I think I'm ready to jet
Grab a scroll, teleport
Destiny's roll, it's my sport
I know how to lift the stakes
Got a Moon-and-Star to raise?
In Morrowind, karma's kinda dead
You wanna play your cards close
With the undead

Baby you'll want a great hand
When you take a gamble in Morrowind
Place some bets, pay your debts
Or make plans to kick the bucket
Bite the dust and then taste ash

I'm gonna crack a flin bottle
Do you want a couple sips?
Writ of execution equipped, sword buckled to my hip
With a pocket full of spells
And another full of tips
Saddle up, we're cashin' in

Welcome to Vvardenfell, step into an ashland
We don't got no script for
What goes down in Tamriel
This ain't no place for keepin' secrets
Seal your lips or Rest In Peace
It could cost your life
Go on and toss the dice

Fell out of grace with Azura
Guess I'm dead to her
But a hero would never shoot a messenger
Forget the blight storm
Watch your step for predators
If you haven't met a cliffracer
Yet you better get insured
My run of bad luck's 'bout to add up
I'll have to cash out, I'm stackin' curses up
Fresh out of potions, and half my stats suck
Plus, I'm over-encumbered with loot
I've packed up
But I gotta trudge on, rain or shine
I'm gonna make sure I deliver right on time
It's a federal offense when you
Mess with the Nerevarine
I'm goin' postal on the Dunmer's Dream
Telvanni, Hlaalu, and Redoran
Leave it up to me to keep 'em beefin'
Got myself a Vivec who I'd
Never have a qualm with
Two heads are better than one - ask a s'wit

You tried to murder and bury me
Was it worth it jerks?
You showed me no mercy
Now look how we're reversed
Remember when you're deserted that
You burned me first
I'll tell your mother why you're missing
She's a worrier no, this ain't your day
It'll get worse and worse
Don't have my own place
I came to dirty yours
Hope you heard my terms
I didn't slur my words
Red Mountain, I'd like to purchase, sir
Turn it over to the Nerevarine
I'm getting even with the Dagoth
When I play odds they wanted corprus
But they're gonna take loss
I'll leave you in chains
Enslaved by Sixth House
Now take a look at who's
Been played by great cons
How are you handling my fallout?
I'm a small guy who's makin' tall clouds
I'm goin' all out, calling ascended out
Run motherfucker 'cause Dagoth Ur
'bout to fall down
Pay your debts and you'll be fine
Otherwise you might get paralyzed
That's kinda like takin' a bet
With a fully loaded staff
Playin' Russian roulette
The ash is hot but the hearts are cold
If you're in too deep then you'll wanna fold
Just like a tumbleweed I'm on a roll
Just like a tumbleweed I'm on a roll
